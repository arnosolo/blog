## Others Projects

- The starting point of my web development journey is a youtube video created by The Coding Train called [Coding Challenge #3: The Snake Game](https://youtu.be/AaGK-fj-BAM?si=SSr5bNt-NjuQ7Ez6). Basically, this video taught you how to create a simple snake game. Through this video I found drawing on a canvas was fun, so I reproduced some works according to some other similar videos, and created something similar like this one: [Oversimplified Gravity Simulator](https://arnosolo.github.io/oversimplified_gravity_simulator/). Basically, some small balls are drawn on a canvas, and they are attracted by each other. During the time of writing this project, some buttons for adjusting parameters need to be drawn, and I found my way of drawing the GUI clumsy. So I started learning frontend frameworks like vue, react. This helped me landing my first frontend job.
- Another interest of mine was embedded software like [building firmware of a 3D printer](https://arnosolo.github.io/simple-3d-printer). It was fun, unfortunately I could not find a related job, so I was not able to make progress in this area.

### Native iOS

- [Birthday Reminder](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/birthday-reminder-lunar-cal/id6479518154) is the simple yet effective iOS app designed exclusively for keeping track of birthdays.
- [Customizable Calculator](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/customizable-calculator/id6446835863) is a calculator that can change layout.
- [Shutter Stamp](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/metadata-watermark/id6474674942) can add a footer on a photo. The footer contains some metadata items of the photo such as logo of camera maker, camera model, focal length, F number, exposure time, ISO.
